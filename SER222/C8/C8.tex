\section{Introduction}
A recursive function is a funciton that calls itself. That's all there is to
it. Recursion is very powerful and can solve many of the problems we use loops
to solve.

\section{Lists}
Lists can be defined recursively by being thought of as an element at the
beginning and a list of everything else at the end, or just the first element
if nothing else exists. This definition of a list uses the word ``list'' inside
of the definition, so it is recursive. The situation in which a list is just
one element is the definition's ``base case''.
